Simple attempt of drawing big terrains in OpenGL with the geomipmapping level of detail algorithm.

Note: The repo doesn't contain the height- and texture maps for the program, since they are over 100 MB.

If you want them contact me tomius1994@gmail.com 

Here's a picture of the program's current capability (it's a 6000 * 6000 terrain extracted from Google Earth):
